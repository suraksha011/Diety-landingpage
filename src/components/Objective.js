                        Across the world, millions of people are struggling with dietary restrictions due to allergies, intolerances, and health conditions. In fact, over 2 billion people globally suffer from some form of dietary restriction, leading to difficulty finding suitable food and managing their health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With food allergies affecting up to 10% of the global population and chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and celiac disease affecting millions more, the need for personalized dietary solutions has never been greater.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Studies show that around 7% of children suffer from food allergies, and the number continues to grow. Furthermore, millions of adults struggle with finding foods that meet their specific dietary needs, making daily life challenging and overwhelming.

                    <p>
                        Our goal is to provide a solution that simplifies managing these dietary needs through technology, offering real-time assistance with food choices, meal planning, and allergy identification, allowing users to live healthier lives.

                        By leveraging AI, we can recommend foods and meals that meet dietary restrictions and preferences, making it easier for people to make informed decisions about what they eat. With DIETY, we aim to revolutionize the way individuals with special dietary needs access and manage their nutrition.
